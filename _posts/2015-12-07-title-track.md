What's up everyone, welcome to hagridaaron.com 

This site is build with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole).

I'm currently a SysAdmin working at [Fuller Theological Seminary](http://www.fuller.edu). I help support our Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X systems on campus and abroad. Along the way I'm able to dive into sweet side projects, and research topics that help push fuller into the future of technology. With my trusty companion [@vicenac](http://twitter.com/vicenac) at my side, I will dive into some really sweet R&D projects surrounding Cloud Computing, Load Balancing, Automation, Virtualization and tons of other super nerdy topics.

Keep The Skies Clear
